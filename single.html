			<h2>What's new?</h2>
			<p>The CSS-Tricks front end is usually pretty darn fast, because most pages are cached (and don't need to be dynamically generated when requested). However, up until recently, the CSS-Tricks WordPress admin didn't have the same luck.</p>
			<p>In particular, the post editing screen was slow. Painfully slow. Saving a draft took several seconds, which is enough to break your flow in the middle of writing an article.</p>

			<h3>Witch part of this is really amazing?</h3>
			<p>I was planning to write up a full review of the app but decided that forming an opinion on it after only a few days of use (and not even on a real project) would be unfair. Instead, I decided that we could unbox it together and see what it's all about. This is a video of my first experience with GitHub Desktop from download to first commit. I wasn't sure what to expect and now you can watch me fumble around with it for the first time.</p>

			<p>Wait, doesn't GitHub already have two desktop apps? If the same question crossed your mind when you first read that, then you are not alone. Yes, GitHub did have two desktop apps—one for Mac OS and one for Windows—but decided to unify them into a single app. Instead of GitHub for Mac and GitHub for Windows, we are now left with just <strong>GitHub Desktop</strong>.</p>

			<p>This screencast is about all that stuff. It's about tying it all together. It's about connecting together the design workflow and the software used there with the front end workflow and the syntax used there. You need to know how to output the images in the formats and sizes you need. You need to know when you'll get quality output and when you won't. You need to know how to measure those images and use the right numbers where. You need to know how to connect your layout choices and media queries with those numbers. It's all in here.</p>
